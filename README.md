# Sequra test
This is the coding challenge for people who applied to a backend developer position at SeQura. It's been designed to be a simplified version of the same problems we deal with.

## Setup

From `Rails 6.1.5` and having `Postgresql >= 9.5`, `Ruby: 2.7.4` libraries execute:

```shell
bundle install
bundle exec rails db:setup
rails s
```
